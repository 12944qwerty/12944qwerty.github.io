Who Am I?
</div>
Hi! So, I’m Perseus Achilles, who isn’t claimed yet, but is in Nature. I want to be the master of the chronicle team. I’m 15 years old IRL. My alts are Perry Achilles (unclaimed and in Force), Maha Garner (Zeusling, Might), and Penny Jackson (unclaimed, Might, but is getting deleted I believe). I’m quite active on Maha Garner but I hope to change things up and be active on multiple accounts rather than one. I try to be online as much as possible- but first finish everything I have first. (BTW, I’m in CST so I’ll only be active during the morning of CST XD) This way I can also get more points for clusters. I love this site and I want to also be involved in helping this site as well as the community in it and making sure everything goes according to the rules. If I do get selected, I would like to change my name to Chidi Pondo.

Chidi Pondo would be a fun person to be around. He isn’t very lazy and becomes friends with everyone, easily. Although he is strict at times, he lets it off kindly and cheerfully so that everyone feels good inside. He also is generous and tries offering help whenever others want or need it.

Why Me?
</div>

Why not me? If something doesn’t go along with the rules in a chronicle, I’ll try to be kind and let them know as kindly as possible. I am more straightforward and direct to people. I love talking with everyone and interacting with everyone. I love having fun and making different jokes- including inside jokes- with them all. They’re my best friends and I love hanging out with all of them.

I also love reading. I love reading fiction books and Percy Jackson related stuff especially. Even if the story/plot isn’t very great, I still love reading it. I would read a bunch of chronicles at once. Although my writing isn’t very great, I have writer’s block, I try my best to write even better and more without over repeating multiple things. Reading has always been my hobby, I used to read fanfictions day and night so much that my parents banned it at my house. For me, reading chronicles would be fun and relieving in stress because I love reading.

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Experience
</div>
A couple of friends on WoO and I have started making fanfiction. My job is the reality approver or making sure that everything is correct through the mythology standpoint. This role is really similar to being a chronicler because of how I have to make sure that the story follows all of the rules that mythology has. This includes relationships, powers, etc. I have to make sure that the story follows the rules, and they’re making it as accurate to mythology standards as possible.
Being a reality approver helps me make sure everything is realistic and follows the rules/mythomagical rules. It makes me think about making sure it follows the rules while reading it for fun simultaneously.

Strengths and Weaknesses
</div>

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Strength - Kindness
</div>
I’m a kind person, I love listening to other peoples’ stories and helping other people. I listen patiently, and try helping them whenever and however I can. Even if I’m doing something else, I put it down and try helping them. I also help people who don’t even ask for help, I see that they are having problems and immediately offer help. I am on the homework team in Might so I can help people with their homework. I am also in the welcoming team in Might to welcome new people and show them the way around (and our chaotic chat xD)

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Strength - Objectiveness
</div>
Although people on the receiving end may view this as a weakness, I believe it to be a strength. Whenever I grade something, for me or someone else, I’m always really hard on it, trying to see if it is perfect. However, being perfect helps. If I am objective, I can always find a mistake. By looking at this, people will realize this mistake and fix this. 

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Strength - Humorous
</div>
I also love to keep things upbeat or humorous. If something becomes sad or feels empty, I try to make a joke or say something that will keep everything and everyone happy. I hate it when it becomes down or sad and I try to humor people. But I wouldn’t do so at the most grim times obviously, like a funeral or something. Just at times where the sadness isn’t as great to keep everyone happy. I believe that the main reason I do this though is because I’ve found that being happy, or enjoying the present, helps everyone work better.

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Weakness - Failure
</div>
I don’t like failure. I really don’t like it. I’m kind of a perfectionist and I don’t like it if something doesn’t go the way I expect. That’s also a reason why I’m closed off a bit. Although online sites like this help to keep me involved more, I always feel like other people will think differently of me, or weird of me if I do something else. I’ve been like this all my life, I’ve never actually done something that would help me improve. I’ve only actually been with my friends and been open. Thankfully, my parents have tried to help me as much as they could and I’m getting better at interacting with new people. But I’m trying to get past the block everyday.

<div style="font-size:15px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:20px;">
Weakness - Time Management
</div>
I absolutely suck at time management. Even though I always get my work done completely, it takes hours sometimes. I normally do my homework but then get distracted by something else and start doing that. I never complete everything right away. However, my family is helping me get through this. They have set a system to make sure I complete everything, before working on what I want to. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always work. I try to follow it because I get distracted way too easily. However, I always complete my work when I need to.

Example Chronicle

<i>Disclaimer: I called the godly parent Mike as a gender-neutral name. I used 'he' and 'him' and 'his' because I didn't know who my godly parent is for this account. I also made the mortal parent a woman. I'll fix this as soon as I get my godly parent. But for the time being, I'm assuming that my godly parent is male, and my mortal parent is female.</i>
9 years ago, Jenny Pondo, a clear-sighted mortal caught the eye of a god. This god noticed her quickly, she was really beautiful. They talked and dated for quite some time. The god never told Jenny who he really was, he went by the alias of Mike. And Jenny never told Mike that she knew who he was. Finally, they decided to take it a step further and made love. Jenny got pregnant and decided it was time to tell each other their secrets. Mike was surprised, to say the least, but decided it was fate that set them together. A clear-sighted parent would be best for demigods. Mike kept visiting Jenny while she was pregnant but after the one day in the hospital, he stopped showing up. All he left was a note and a wristband. The note said:<br/><br/>
<i>Dear Jenny, I'm sorry for leaving you but the ancient laws forbid me from staying with you, (or

</div>visiting you). I wish I could see my son as well, but the same laws forbid me. I'll be watching from above and protecting both of you to the best of my ability. As a parting gift, I give this enchanted wristband. Please give my son this note and the wristband when he is ready.<br/>
To my son, If you're reading this, then that means that you know who you really are. I'm sorry for leaving you, I never wanted to but I had to. The Fates wouldn't allow it. I give you this wristband. Just say your name and it will transform into a sword. Hopefully, you can train with this. It is perfect for you and will change as needed as you grow. I'm sorry again my daughter.</i>
<br>Jenny gave birth to a wonderful son and wished that Mike could see his son once. Unfortunately, he never came back. But what they didn't know was that Mike was always watching her.

</div>
Hello USER!<br>
	<div style="margin-left:10px;">I’m the head of the chronicle team, and we’re a team that reviews your chronicles and PTs and ensures that they follow the rules set by the site. I noticed that you broke the following rules in your chronicle.<br>
	Rule number 5 states: “Your character must be at least 18 to smoke or get tattoos, but you may be any age to have piercings.” In your chronicle, I noticed that you said you got tattoos at an age of 15. This is not allowed and please fix this as soon as possible.<br>
	You also claimed to have a relation to Percy Jackson. You aren’t allowed to do so as said in rule number 4: “You are not allowed to claim to have any relation to the original characters from the books and movies excluding your godly parent.”. This rule is there to avoid copyright infringement so please try to fix this as soon as possible as well.<br>
	When you do fix this, please tell me, or another chronicler that you have fixed it so we can check you off.<br></div>
	Thank you! <3<br>
	Chidi Pondo (Master of Chronicle Team)

Scenario
</div>
<i>You’ve been the Chronicle Master for a while now and everything has been going great! However, you’re noticing some behavior problems start to arise in the general chat with one of your authors. They are bullying campers, not acting welcoming, and not listening to management. How would you handle this situation?</i><br>
	<span style="margin-left:20px;">I would ask them to be kind to everyone and do not argue against staff, especially management. I would give them three strikes and the last strike would remove them from their job. I believe that giving them three strikes after they’ve been asked by multiple other staff and campers is more than enough chances. Hopefully, they’ll stop and become nicer again. If they don’t, (I don’t really know the process of banning someone in WoO or anything) but I'll give them 3 more strikes, send them a warning IM. If they still don’t listen, I guess I’d, unfortunately, have to ban them.</span>

<div style="font-size:22px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;margin-bottom:20px;">
Organization
</div>
<i>Disclaimer: This idea is from the Welcoming Log from Might. I just liked the idea of having a log like that so much that I think it would work well for making sure who finishes or doesn’t.</i><br>
	I got this idea from the Might’s welcoming team spreadsheet for remembering who had welcomed who. I made a <a href="https://forms.gle/HryJKfhiVLHsUxn19">form</a> that will help log things into the following log (spreadsheet) easily. I tried setting an example up: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeHaAYeYJxEsrSt-dRz9SyM5inIZWeJLifdaMIgrjzc/edit?usp=sharing">Example!</a>. Hopefully, it shows what I envisioned. The counter just helps me know how many each person has done each week. I believe that because there are 10000+ users on WoO, the entire team should check about 100 each week. Many people update regularly so I will reset the google sheet every month to make sure that they see the updated chronicles. This also prevents regular checking of already-checked chronicles. <br>

	I also heard from some friends that are smurfs, that they have to check about 30 chronicles a week and it gets hard to do so because they’re busy. This means that we’ll need more smurfs than just four (including me). This way, with 5 or 6 people, each person has to check about 15-20 chronicles each week. This allows them to interact and have fun, as well as have time to be with us on WoO and manage their IRL problems/stuff.<br>

	We can also set up a group DM on discord, or a group IM on WoO to communicate with each other. This way, I can always make sure that each person has done it, and they can tell me that they won’t be able to do it for a certain time period.<br>

I also believe that to get into the team, one doesn’t have to write a chronicle of another person to get it. As this team is about making sure that all chronicles fit the rules, I believe that they should have to read an example chronicle that I would set up that breaks a bunch of the rules in discrete ways. To apply, they have to read it and try to find 2-3 of these errors and report them with an example IM like below. The more errors they find, the higher the chance they get in. If they add more details when making the example IM, the higher chance they get in. An example of the chronicle with errors could be this one: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GDX8B3QOQZDO">Example!</a> This example breaks a couple of rules, the kid gets a tattoo at 10 years old, he met his godly parent physically, he has a direct relation with one of the original characters.<br>

I also noticed that there is a rule stating that a user must have a chronicle within two weeks of them joining. I believe that this rule isn’t needed, or the period of time should be longer because many people might leave for two weeks to get VIP so they can make a proper coded chronicle/PT. These people also might leave for a longer period of time because of IRL work and problems they might have. They might also be getting used to the site and generating ideas on what to write in their chronicles. A lot of people don’t actually make a chronicle within two weeks because they don’t have enough time, they don’t have enough content, or because they don’t want a black and white, boring chronicle.
